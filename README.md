## Description <a name="introduction"></a>
This project uses mongoDB and mongoose to store workouts through a simple two page front-end interface. It has logic built in for adding multiple exercises to a single workout, adding both cardio and strength-training exercises of user input, and modifying the most recent workout by date if you want to add an exercise. 

It also has a statistics page which will show your stats based on the last seven days of workouts you've done using chart.js to demonstrate the most interesting data. 

### Motivation
This project is exciting to me since I have a background in personal training and I believe exercise is an important part of living a full life. This is a very easy to use app that has a great UX. Another idea that I may implement in the future is a note section for the user, a blog section for SEO and user information, and also building a front-end spreadsheet which will autopopulate weights based on the user lifts and percentages based on the type of exercies they'd like to do.

### Problem Solved
This MVP is built to help users track their workouts, exercises within their workouts, as well as see their workout details over the last 7 days to track their progress.
